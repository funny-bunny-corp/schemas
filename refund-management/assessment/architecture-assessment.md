## Domain Model Maturity

| Aspect | Score | Comments |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Domain Boundaries | 4/5 | Clear boundaries, minor overlap concerns |
| Business Rules | 4/5 | Excellent business rule documentation |
| Event Coverage | 1/5 | Critically insufficient event model |
| Domain Model Depth | 2/5 | Shallow domain model implementation |
| Integration Patterns | 2/5 | Limited integration capabilities |

## Comparison with Other Contexts

### Relative Maturity
- **Most similar**: Merchant Account Management (similar scope limitations)
- **Least mature**: Significantly behind Payment Processing and Fraud Detection
- **Best practices needed**: Event modeling from Payment Processing, domain depth from Fraud Detection

## Strategic Assessment

### Current State
- **Policy documentation**: Excellent business rule and policy documentation
- **Limited implementation**: Minimal technical implementation of domain capabilities
- **Integration gaps**: Insufficient integration with other contexts

### Target State
- **Complete refund platform**: Full refund lifecycle management with workflow orchestration
- **Policy engine**: Dynamic policy management and enforcement
- **Rich integration**: Strong coordination with all relevant contexts

### Gap Analysis
- **Event model**: Needs 10+ additional event types for completeness
- **Domain model**: Needs significant deepening of aggregates and behaviors
- **Integration**: Needs comprehensive integration patterns

## Conclusion

The Refund Management bounded context has excellent business rule documentation and clear domain purpose, but suffers from severe implementation gaps. The single-event model is critically insufficient for a domain responsible for managing complex refund workflows.

While the business analysis and policy framework are strong, the technical implementation appears to be at a very early stage. This creates a significant risk for the overall payment gateway system, as refund management is a critical customer-facing capability.

**Strategic Recommendation**: This context requires urgent and significant investment to reach production readiness. The gap between business requirements and technical implementation is the largest among all contexts.

**Risk Assessment**: **HIGH RISK** - The current implementation is insufficient to support production refund workflows and could create customer satisfaction issues and operational bottlenecks.

**Immediate Actions Required**:
1. Expand event model to support complete refund workflows
2. Implement proper integration with Payment Processing
3. Develop comprehensive domain model with behavioral patterns
