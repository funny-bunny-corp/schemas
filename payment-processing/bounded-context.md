# Payment Processing Bounded Context

## Overview

The **Payment Processing** bounded context is the core domain responsible for orchestrating and executing payment transactions within the payment gateway subdomain. It handles the complete lifecycle of payment processing, from initial payment creation through transaction approval or decline, including refund operations.

## Purpose

This bounded context exists to:
- Process payment transactions securely and efficiently
- Manage the complete payment lifecycle from initiation to completion
- Coordinate with external payment processors and financial institutions
- Ensure transaction integrity and idempotency
- Provide real-time payment status updates
- Handle both payment and refund operations

## Domain Boundaries

### What's Inside the Boundary

**Core Domain Objects:**
- **Payment**: The primary aggregate representing a payment transaction
- **Checkout**: Session information that initiates payment processing
- **Transaction**: The actual financial transaction processed through payment networks
- **Refund**: Reversal of previously processed payments
- **Payment Order**: Orchestration of payment processing workflow

**Key Business Processes:**
- Payment creation and validation
- Transaction processing and authorization
- Payment status management
- Refund processing
- Payment order orchestration

**Domain Events:**
- `PaymentCreated`: Triggered when a new payment is initiated
- `PaymentOrderStarted`: Indicates the beginning of payment processing
- `TransactionApproved`: Confirms successful payment authorization
- `TransactionDeclined`: Indicates payment authorization failure
- `PaymentDone`: Signals completion of payment processing
- `RefundCreated`: Initiates refund processing
- `RefundStarted`: Begins refund execution
- `SellersOrders`: Manages merchant order information

### What's Outside the Boundary

**Fraud Detection**: Risk assessment and fraud prevention (handled by Fraud Detection BC)
**Merchant Account Management**: Merchant wallet and account management (handled by Merchant Account Management BC)
**Financial Recording**: Accounting and financial reporting (handled by Financial Recording & Reporting BC)
**Refund Management**: Refund policy and business rules (handled by Refund Management BC)

## Domain Events

### Incoming Events
- Risk assessment results from Fraud Detection BC
- Merchant account status from Merchant Account Management BC
- Refund requests from Refund Management BC

### Outgoing Events
- `PaymentCreated`: Notifies other contexts about new payment initiation
- `TransactionApproved`: Signals successful payment to downstream systems
- `TransactionDeclined`: Notifies about payment failures
- `PaymentDone`: Indicates payment completion for settlement
- `RefundCreated`: Initiates refund processing workflow

## Ubiquitous Language

**Payment**: A financial transaction initiated by a buyer to transfer funds to a seller
**Checkout**: The session where payment details are collected and validated
**Transaction**: The actual financial operation processed through payment networks
**Authorization**: The process of validating and approving a payment request
**Settlement**: The final transfer of funds between parties
**Refund**: The reversal of a previously completed payment
**Idempotence**: Ensuring duplicate requests don't create multiple transactions

## Strategic Context

### Core Domain
Payment Processing is a **Core Domain** as it directly provides value to customers and is essential for the business model.

### Dependencies
- **Upstream**: Fraud Detection (for risk assessment)
- **Downstream**: Financial Recording & Reporting, Merchant Account Management
- **External**: Payment processors, banking networks, card schemes

## Integration Patterns

### Event-Driven Integration
- Publishes domain events for payment lifecycle changes
- Consumes events from Fraud Detection for risk decisions
- Integrates with Refund Management for refund operations

### API Integration
- RESTful APIs for payment initiation and status queries
- Webhook endpoints for real-time status updates
- Integration with external payment processors

## Business Rules

1. **Idempotency**: All payment operations must be idempotent using unique keys
2. **Amount Validation**: Payment amounts must be positive and properly formatted
3. **Currency Consistency**: Currency must match between payment and refund operations
4. **Status Transitions**: Payment status must follow defined state machine rules
5. **Security**: All payment data must be tokenized and encrypted

## Success Metrics

- Payment success rate
- Transaction processing time
- System availability and uptime
- Error rates and resolution time
- Compliance with payment industry standards
